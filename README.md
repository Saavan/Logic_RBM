Public Code Repository for Nature Electronics "Logically Synthesized, Hardware-Accelerated, Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Combinatorial Optimization and Integer Factorization"

This repository is broken into two folders, a hardware and a software code base. The hardware codebase includes verilog code, which has been scrubbed of Xilinx and Xillybus IP, to reproduce results from the paper. The software codebase contains basic RBM starter code and training algorithms to reproduce the testing and training of our system.
